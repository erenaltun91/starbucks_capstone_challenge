Project 6 of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program - Starbucks Capstone Challenge
This project loads data about disaster messages, displays visual on a web page and estimates the category of the message, which will also displayed on a web page.

Installations
Put the files in this repo into a folder of your choice
Install following python libraries:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, sqlalchemy, pickle,sklearn, flask, plotly
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install nltk
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install pickle
pip install sklearn
pip install flask
pip install plotly

Project Motivation
In the course of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Prgram this analysis was done to classify messages from disasters
Messages, which were already classified are used to train models to classify new messages
Models have been tuned for better performance
File Descriptions
data/disaster_categories.csv

Categories of different disasters
data/disaster_messages.csv

Messages of different disasters
data/process_data.py

Loads and cleans data
Merges both csv-files
Saves data as database file
models/train_classifier.py

Loads data from database file
Trains models and prints out evaluation metrics
app/run.py

Building the web page
Using data to display visuals
Using model to predict categories of new messages
master.html

Web page with visuals
go.html

Web page with classification method
Usage
Opem the command terminal

Set your chosen folder as the workingspace

Run the following commands in terminal:

Loading and cleaning of the data and saving data in a db-file
python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
Loading the data from the db file and training a model with an evaluation of that model
python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
Run this model in an application
python app/run.py
Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/ or https://view6914b2f4-3001.udacity-student-workspaces.com/ and type in the message you want to classify

I tried: "There is a storm!"
Summary
The most common category is 'related' and the least common category is 'child_alone'
The evaluation of the model seem good
The classification could be better
