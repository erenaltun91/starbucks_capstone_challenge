# Project 6 of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program - Starbucks Capstone Challenge
This project uses demographic, transaction and offer data to find demographic groups which respond best to certain offer types.

## Installations
- Put the files in the data directory into a folder of your choice  
- Install following python libraries:  
    - pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pickle,sklearn, plotly , seaborn
  
`pip install numpy`  
`pip install pandas`  
`pip install matplotlib`  
`pip install sqlalchemy`  
`pip install pickle`  
`pip install sklearn`  
`pip install plotly`
`pip install seaborn`

## Project Motivation
- In this last project of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program these data sets were used to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer types.

## File Description  
- data/portfolio.json  
  - data about offers and requirements to complete offers  

- data/profile.json  
  - demographic data

- data/transcript.json  
  - information about descriptions of offers and transaction data 

## Usage
- Download the jupyter notebook and feel free to enjoy

## Summary
For getting an overall good response for offers I would recommend to give offers to female members older than 50 years, who are longer a part of the starbucks community. The income should be higher than 70,000 USD a year. For the offer type I think it does not matter if it is the bogo or the discount offer but the discount offer is completed slightly better than the bogo offer.
